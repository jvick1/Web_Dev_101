# Web_Dev_101

This repo aims to provide an introduction to coding with CSS and JavaScript, focusing on creating responsive web pages through project-based learning.

In the CSS section, we'll work with IDs, classes, and divisions, text properties, image styling, and navigation rules. The JavaScript section covers foundational concepts like placement and output, progressing to variables, arithmetic operators, arrays, conditional statements, loops, events, and functions, enabling students to integrate dynamic client-side functionality into their web pages.

Please note that while Anchor does not currently support Windows, we'll leverage the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to create a Linux environment for Website development.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Setup WSL.

To utilize WSL, open `cmd.exe` in Admin mode and execute the following command:

```bash
wsl --install
```

This command installs the required components, downloads the latest Linux kernel, sets WSL 2 as default, and installs a Linux distribution (Ubuntu by default). 

**Restart your computer after the installation.**

You'll have to make a UN & PW for the new Ubuntu terminal.
