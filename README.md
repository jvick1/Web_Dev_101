# Web_Dev_101

This repo aims to provide an introduction to coding with CSS and JavaScript, focusing on creating responsive web pages through project-based learning.

In the **CSS section**, we'll work with IDs, classes, and divisions, text properties, image styling, and navigation rules. 
The **JavaScript section** covers foundational concepts like placement and output, progressing to variables, arithmetic operators, arrays, conditional statements, loops, events, and functions, enabling students to integrate dynamic client-side functionality into their web pages.

We'll leverage the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to create a Linux environment for Website development.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Setup WSL.

To utilize WSL, open `cmd.exe` in Admin mode and execute the following command:

```bash
wsl --install
```

This command installs the required components, downloads the latest Linux kernel, sets WSL 2 as default, and installs a Linux distribution (Ubuntu by default). 

**Restart your computer after the installation.**

You'll have to make a UN & PW for the new Ubuntu terminal.

### üìÄ Installing Node.js.
Access the Ubuntu Terminal by searching for "Ubuntu" in your Start menu. 

Follow [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl) or use these commands to install Node.js using nvm:

```
// Install Curl
sudo apt-get install curl

// Install NVM
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash

// Restart Ubuntu Terminal

// Test if nvm exists - this will return "nvm" and not a version number if working correctly!
command -v nvm

// Install the latest version of Node.js
nvm install --lts
```

**Remember to run all terminal commands in the Ubuntu Terminal from now on.**

### Create a New React App:

Use the `create-react-app` tool to create a new React application. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
npx create-react-app web_dev
```

and then let's create a new project called web_dev

```
cd web_dev
```

Run the following command to start the development server and view your React app in the browser:

```
npm start
```

This command will automatically open your default web browser and serve your React app at `http://localhost:3000`.
